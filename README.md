## Weather Application Documentation

### Installation Instructions

Before running the project, make sure you have Node.js and npm installed on your machine. Then, follow these steps:

1. Clone the project repository from GitHub:

   ```
   git clone <repository_url>
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```
   cd weather-application
   ```

3. Install dependencies using npm:

   ```
   npm install
   ```

### Building Instructions

To run the project, execute the following command in the project directory:

```
npm start
```

This will start the development server and open the application in your default web browser.

### Functionality Overview

The Weather application is a simple yet powerful tool for accessing real-time weather information. It leverages React.js to create a dynamic and responsive user interface. Below are the key features and functionalities of the Weather application:

Search Functionality: Users can input the name of a city in the provided search bar and hit Enter to retrieve the current weather information for that city. This feature allows users to quickly access weather data for locations of interest.

Dynamic Background: The application dynamically adjusts its background color based on the temperature of the location being queried. This visual cue provides users with an intuitive understanding of the weather conditions at a glance.

Current Weather Display: Upon entering a valid city name and pressing Enter, the application fetches and displays essential weather information for the specified location. This includes the city name, country code, current date and time, temperature (in Celsius), and a brief description of the weather condition (e.g., sunny, cloudy, rainy).

Responsive Design: The application is designed to be responsive, ensuring a seamless user experience across various devices and screen sizes. Whether accessed on a desktop, tablet, or smartphone, users can easily interact with the application and view weather updates.

Data Retrieval: The Weather application fetches weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API, a widely used service for accessing weather forecasts and historical weather data. This ensures that users receive accurate and up-to-date information about weather conditions worldwide.

Overall, the Weather application provides a user-friendly interface for accessing real-time weather updates, making it a valuable tool for individuals who need to stay informed about current weather conditions in different locations.

### Dependencies

The project relies on the following dependencies:

- "@testing-library/jest-dom": "^5.17.0"
- "@testing-library/react": "^13.4.0"
- "@testing-library/user-event": "^13.5.0"
- "react": "^18.2.0"
- "react-dom": "^18.2.0"
- "react-scripts": "5.0.1"
- "web-vitals": "^2.1.4"

These packages are automatically installed when running `npm install`.

### Code Over view

Certainly! Let's break down the snippets:

### `App.js`

```jsx
import React, { useState } from "react";

// API configuration
const api = {
  key: "3317e4759ed57092eb2818eddd50a9b9",
  base: "https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/",
};

function App() {
  const [query, setQuery] = useState(""); // State for user input
  const [weather, setWeather] = useState({}); // State for weather data

  // Function to fetch weather data from API
  const search = (evt) => {
    if (evt.key === "Enter") {
      fetch(`${api.base}weather?q=${query}&units=metric&APPID=${api.key}`)
        .then((res) => res.json())
        .then((result) => {
          setWeather(result);
          setQuery("");
        });
    }
  };

  // Function to format date
  const dateBuilder = (d) => {
    // Implementation omitted for brevity
  };

  return (
    <div
      className={
        typeof weather.main !== "undefined"
          ? weather.main.temp > 16
            ? "app warm"
            : "app"
          : "app"
      }
    >
      {/* Main content of the application */}
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
```

**Explanation:**

- This component is the main component of the Weather application.
- It imports React and useState hook from React library.
- Defines an object `api` to hold the API key and base URL for fetching weather data.
- Uses the `useState` hook to manage state variables `query` (for user input) and `weather` (for weather data).
- Defines a function `search` to fetch weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API when the user presses Enter after entering a city name.
- Uses the `dateBuilder` function to format the date.
- Returns JSX to render the main content of the application, including conditional CSS classes based on weather conditions.

### `index.js`

```jsx
import React from "react";
import ReactDOM from "react-dom";
import App from "./App";

ReactDOM.render(<App />, document.getElementById("root"));
```

**Explanation:**

- This file is the entry point of the application.
- It imports React and ReactDOM libraries.
- Renders the `App` component inside the HTML element with the id "root" in the DOM, effectively starting the React application.

These snippets illustrate the core functionalities of your React Weather application, including fetching weather data, managing state, and rendering components. Let me know if you need further clarification!
